    "    - [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (1989) is the most common shell. It's what people mean by a shell most of the time. It's default pretty much anywhere, including macOS.\n",
    "    - New shells are fancier or more user friendly. [ZSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) is Bash on steroids, [FISH](https://fishshell.com) is a re-imagining of a shell for the 1990s (that's considered *new* for shells), and [Xonsh](http://xonsh.org) is a shell written in Python 3.\n",

    "* `setup.py`\n",
    "    - You can make an installable package\n",
    "    - Uses setuptools (third-party, but ubiquitous like pip) or distutils (standard library, but not recommended)\n",
